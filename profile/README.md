# Ritter Antoine's School Projects

This organization contains all the projects that I have done during my studies at CESI.

## Repository organization

All the repositories are named with the following pattern: `<School>_<Year>_<Module>_<Type>_<Number>`

- `<School>`: The school where the project was done.
- `<Year>`: The year when the project was done.
- `<Module>`: The module where the project was done.
- `<Type>`: The type of the project (Prosit, Project, ...).
- `<Number>`: The number of the project.
